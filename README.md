## Run it yourself: 

### Local
#### Setup (Dependencies) 
First clone this repository. Then pip (or conda) install all dependencies.
To do so use: 

* Use ` pip install -r requirements.txt` in this directory
* **OR** manually pip (or conda) install these dependencies:
    * [`pip install pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)
    * [`pip install scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
    * [`pip install bokeh`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html)
    * [`pip install panel`](https://panel.holoviz.org/)
    * [`pip install holoviews`](https://holoviews.org/install.html)
    * [`pip install colorcet`](https://colorcet.holoviz.org/getting_started/index.html)

#### Run Bokeh server
run `bokeh serve --show ExploreKFold` in this directory.
Now Bokeh should open a new browser (tab) and display the dashboard. 

### Online
Here is a link to a deployed online version:

**Please note**:  
This link will not always work. Due to my use of the hobby version of [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) this version is limited in how many people can access it at the same time.
